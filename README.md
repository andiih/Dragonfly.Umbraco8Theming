# Dragonfly.Umbraco8Theming #

A Theming system for Umbraco version 8 created by [Heather Floyd](https://www.HeatherFloyd.com).

For a general explanation, see the article:

 [How to Create Multiple Unique Sites in One Installation Using Theming and the Umbraco Grid](https://24days.in/umbraco-cms/2016/unique-sites-using-theming/)

This package will install a few examples in the "Views" folder, along with a Themes folder which includes an unstyled "starter" theme.

Credit goes to [Shannon Deminick's *Articulate* package](https://github.com/Shazwazza/Articulate) for inspiration and initial code.

**NOTE** This project is being ported from the [v7 version](https://github.com/hfloyd/Dragonfly.UmbracoTheming) and is still "under construction".
